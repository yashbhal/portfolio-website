              I graduated from Arizona State University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and currently work as a Software Developer at Microchip Technology. <br />
              I'm passionate about technology and am interested in the fields of mixed reality (AR, VR, and XR), machine learning, and embedded software development. <br />
              I love solving problems, learning new skills, and enjoy working in interdisciplinary teams to build great products.<br /> 
              In free time, you can find me playing soccer, video games, or experimenting with code.
